# GEMINI Context: NetRoute-Pro

## Project Overview
NetRoute-Pro is a professional networking lab project focusing on static routing and network redundancy. It is built for a specialized VirtualBox lab environment.

## Key Files and Directories
- `README.md`: Contains the full project documentation, authors, environment details, and ASCII network topology.
- `commands/`:
    - `host_diag.sh`: Script for host verification.
    - `router_cmds.txt`: Reference for router commands.

## Directory Purpose
The directory manages the lifecycle of a networking lab, from initial configuration to fault tolerance testing. It uses an ASCII-based topology for visual reference in CLI-based environments.

## Usage
Consult `README.md` for the topology and procedure. Use the `commands/` directory to facilitate network diagnostics.

## Development Conventions
- Professional, emoji-free documentation.
- All documentation is centralized in the README.md.
- Network diagrams are provided in ASCII format for maximum compatibility.
