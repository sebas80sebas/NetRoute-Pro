# GEMINI Context: NetLab

## Project Overview
This is a non-code project focused on **Computer Networking Documentation**. It contains lab procedures for configuring routers and managing IP networks. The project is primarily academic or technical training material.

## Key Files
- `REDES DE ORDENADORES.docx`: The core document containing practical exercises (Hitos) for network routing, IP assignment, and troubleshooting.
- `README.md`: High-level overview and usage instructions for the repository.

## Directory Purpose
The directory serves as a centralized repository for networking lab reports and configuration guides. It tracks progress on specific network milestones (Hitos) involving multiple routers (R1, R2, R3, R4) and host offices (hstOfi1, hstOfi2).

## Usage
Users should refer to the `.docx` file for step-by-step instructions on network simulation. The repository can be used to store configuration scripts, packet captures, or topology diagrams in future iterations.

## Development Conventions
- **Naming:** Follows Spanish academic naming conventions (e.g., "Redes de Ordenadores").
- **Documentation:** Focuses on command output verification and troubleshooting steps.
