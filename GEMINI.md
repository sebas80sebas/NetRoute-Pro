# GEMINI Context: NetLab

## Project Overview
This repository contains complete documentation for a Computer Networking lab focused on routing. It has been restructured to include all documentation within the main README.md, removing reliance on external documents.

## Key Files and Directories
- `README.md`: The primary source of documentation, containing lab procedures, milestones, and author information.
- `commands/`: Contains specialized files for diagnostic and configuration commands.
    - `host_diag.sh`: Shell script for host office network verification.
    - `router_cmds.txt`: Reference text for Cisco-style router commands.

## Directory Purpose
The directory serves as a self-contained environment for networking lab reports and configuration guides. It details the setup and testing of a network involving four routers and two host offices.

## Usage
Consult `README.md` for the full lab procedure. Execute `commands/host_diag.sh` on host machines for automated status checks.

## Development Conventions
- Documentation is strictly text-based and formatted in Markdown.
- No emojis are used in the documentation.
- All technical procedures are documented directly in the repository to ensure version control of the lab instructions.
